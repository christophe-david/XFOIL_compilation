    Typical XFOIL session keyboard inputs.
    All commands can be in lowercase.
    Blank lines below are only for easier reading -- they are not Return's!
    A command with its argument(s) ommitted will result in an input prompt.
    Some files in ./runs are used here.

    Note: The Eppler 387 coordinates are not smooth, so the Cp plots will 
          appear "noisy".  Xfoil's results will not be affected noticably 
          by such cosmetic defects, unless they are very severe.

Notes:

1) Sometimes you may not want to automatically write the polar to a file.
In this case the PACC command is followed by a <return> rather than a filename:

PACC
<return>

You can later use PWRT if you decide to write out the polar after all:

PWRT           (will display all stored polars available for writing)
2              (choose polar 2 for writing)
polar2_file    (specify output filename)

This approach is "dangerous" in that if XFOIL crashes, the stored polars 
are lost.  This may or may not be a big deal, depending on how many polar
points you have.  XFOIL doesn't crash very easily, but it can happen.
A common cause is accidental specification of a silly flow condition, e.g.

ALFA 90

In viscous mode this will produce all sorts of numerical fireworks,
and possibly an arithmetic fault.


2) Saved polar files can be plotted with the separate PPLOT program.
Or you can use XFOIL itself, by reading in each polar file via PGET,
and then plotting them via PPLO.  PDEL, PSUM, etc. can also be used
to set up a list of polars that you want to plot.  PPAX can be used 
to change the polar plot axis limits.


3) It is sometimes necessary to change the airfoil name in the polar save file.
This can be easily done with a text editor.  But do not change the other
information headers, since this might confuse the polar file read routine.
