General
-------
XFOIL and its plot library should compile on any Unix system 
with normal Fortran-77, C, and X-Windows support.  So far,
XFOIL has been tested on the following systems:

  DEC-5000
  Alpha
  SGI
* Sun
* RS/6000
* HP-9000
* Pentium/Linux 


The systems marked with "*" have peculiar features which require slight 
modifications to the Makefiles in the plotlib/ and bin/ directories.  
Examine these Makefiles before building the plot library and XFOIL.


Build sequence
--------------

1) Build Orr-Sommerfeld database in ./orrs

 % cd orrs

Follow directions in orrs/README


2) Build the plot library in  ./plotlib  ...

 % cd plotlib
 % edit Makefile        (set compiler flags for your machine)
 % make libPlt.a


3) Build the programs in  ./bin  ...

 % cd bin
 % edit Makefile        (set compiler flags for your machine)
 % make xfoil
 % make pplot
 % make pxplot


Documentation
-------------
User Guide is in the  xfoil.doc  file.  If impatient, you can just
run XFOIL in the runs/ directory, which contains a few input files:

 % cd runs
 % ../bin/xfoil

The file  session.txt  contains keyboard inputs for a typical interactive 
session.  If one is lost when running XFOIL, typing a "?" at any command 
prompt, e.g.  

 .GDES  c>  ?  

will always produce a keyboard command menu.
